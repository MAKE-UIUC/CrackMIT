#Starting The Puzzle

We knew that HackMIT once again, had an entry challenge this year. They said so themselves in their FAQ. But like every year, finding the puzzle wasn’t easy.

This year, the link was hidden in the `.` in `Sept. 19 & 20`.

It took us to http://dogemit.party/.  A page that contained this great doge video. As with everything absurd in a challenge like this, we peered at the page’s source code. It contained, in binary, the link to 0xbaff1edd09e.dogemit.party.

This page contained a github login. This is where everything began.



#Contributors

As much as we ([@modi95](https://github.com/modi95) and [@wchill](https://github.com/wchill)) would like to take all the credit, we would not have been able to complete this challenge if it weren't for the help of some of our friends. We'd like to thank them here:

[@milanocookies93](https://github.com/milanocookies93)

Although he won't admit it, Milan was just as involved as we were. He was with us for all of the 15 or so hours that we spent trying to solve the challenge. Furthermore he was the one who reminded us that the challenge was open. Had it not been for him, we probably won't have noticed until much later.

Mosab recognized me on the DogeMIT Slack. At the time, Eric and I were on Puzzle 1 whereas he was on Puzzle 3. He was the one who pointed us in the _JavaScript_ direction for Puzzle 1. We would have probably spend another couple of hours trying to solve the challege if it weren't for him.

Thomas drops into the ACM Office evey now and then. At the time that he dropped in on Friday, we were trying to solve Puzzle 2. Thomas was far to impatient with this and would not have us waste time trying to fold the pages. He started ripping the pages and sticking them together. You might remember the result from our image in the Puzzle 2 portion of our write-up.
