#Puzzle 2

##Starting
Hitting the Puzzle 2 link took us to a page with a low-poly image of Doge with the text:

>pls bring doge to real world

There nothing much more, so we did the first thing we've come to expect to do - view the page source.

##39 Images

On viewing the page source, we see that there are 39 images that should be displayed on the page. However none of these are currently being rendered
