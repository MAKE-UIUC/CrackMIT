Cracking HackMIT's Puzzles

##Before You Read this

Tl;dr – Spoilers Abound!!!!

Each year, HackMIT has an optional challenge for entry. The first couple of teams that solve this challenge are guaranteed entry to HackMIT. We were one of these couple of teams, and this is a hastily written account of how we solved the challenge.

This write-up was made public *after* all the slots were filled. But even so, please try to solve the puzzles on your own before you read anything here. You may not get anything out of solving them, but they’re still a lot of fun.

Now that we’ve got that out the way – READ ON.
